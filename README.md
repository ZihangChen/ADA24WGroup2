ADA24W Group 2:

This repo contains all the python code used for this project.
All the file are based on the basic data process code at the start and different for each research questions.

To run the code the devGPT dataset is required.
https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT

```
cd ADA24WGroup2
git clone https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT.git
```

The .ipynb files should be in the root directory of the dataset meaning


Use requirements file to download all package:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- DevGPT
	|- snapshot_...
	|- // everything in the DevGPT github repo
- finalProject.ipynb
- regression_analysis.ipynb
- rq-1and3.ipynb

Each file contains:
1. finalProject.ipynb - deep learning and text-based analysis used in RQ2
2. regression_analysis.ipynb - regression analysis and linear regresion model for RQ3
3. rq-1and3.ipynb - data visualization and preprocessing used for milestone 2 and RQ1 and partially RQ3

Thank you!
